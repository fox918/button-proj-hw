== Requirements ==
-12V Power for Matt
-5V for Oliver
-2 Strips for Oliver / 1 for Matt
-1 Button for Oliver



== Power 12V / 5V ==
-Oliver:    Bypass because I got already 5V
-Matt:      12V->5V Linear Regulator
            AZ1117CH-5.0TRG1 in SOT223


== Level Shifter ==
4x Buffer HCT Series, SN74AHCT125DRG4 in SOIC


== Connectors ==
-Oliver: Solder on snap ins
-Matt:   evtl. Mini-XLR

== Proposals ==
SERIES resistor between: Node<->Buffer and Buffer<->Strip
Polyfuse on Input
